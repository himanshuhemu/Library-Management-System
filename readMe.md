#Library Management System 
This is a basic Library management system project I made in my 3rd semester . This is coded in c++ and it uses File Handling for saving and retrieving records or the books. I have made header file of each function to be performed  So as to decrease complexity of the code . 
A lot of improvements are to be done in this project like Handling of Exceptions properly  .
